## Research interests

- Delta formation (shape, sediment input, channels formation and direction)
- Deltas under sea-level changes
- Deltas response with isostatic adjustment from sediment, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA)
- Artic deltas and the Mekong delta
- How much we can explain in flume experiement vs. big scale responses?
