## Research interests

I am broadly interested in developing multi-sector models to inform and propose relevant decision pathways for coastal decision makers in the face of sea level rise. For my Ph.D. thesis, I am looking specifically at the multi-sector dynamics of Long Beach Island (LBI), which is a barrier island located on the coast of New Jersey.

For almost a century, LBI has been stabilized via coastal engineering practices such as beach renourishment, jetty construction, and engineered dune manufacturing. A barrier island engineered to remain stationary exhibits completely different geomorphic behavior than a barrier island in the natural setting where processes like sea level rise and overwash allow the barrier island to roll over itself and prograde landward. 

The problem LBI is facing is that the cost of stabilizing the island is becoming unfeasible due to increasing sea level rise, increasing storm frequency, dwindling off-shore sand deposits, and general economic inflation. An immediate goal is to educate coastal decision makers and stakeholders on the dire state of the situation. With so many people living on the island and the heavy reliance of the New Jersey economy on tourism, a decision pathway for managed retreat must be developed collaboratively with stakeholders and must be quantitatively informed to minimize the risk and harm to people, property, ecosystem services, and economic activity. 

My goal is to develop a suite of modeling tools that will be co-produced with local stakeholders and provide support for decision makers to inform the decision pathways for LBI over the next decades in a quantitative and scientific way. I utilize mechanistic geomorphic modeling, agent based modeling, machine learning, geospatial analysis, multi-objective optimization, and risk and uncertainty analysis and quantification to achieve this end.

## Personal Interests

I love learning about, understanding, and exploring the natural world. This includes hiking, camping, canoeing and kayaking, and wildlife photography. I have a standard schnauzer named Zeno (named after Zeno of Citium). He is always right alongside me to explore the world and one of my best friends. I train for Olympic-style weightlifting and love to workout and go to the gym. I also enjoy playing any strategy game but my favorite game to play is poker. I love the thrill and excitement of the element of chance but only because I can guarantee myself a long term positive expected value by playing optimally according to game theory. I also love to read books about philosophy, specifically theological works and books on the philosophy of religion.

I am quite passionate about helping to bridge the gap seen today between religion and science. My experience is that these groups are oftentimes, due to preconceived notions, unable to see the totality of the benefit and positive effects the other has on society. This leads to mischaracterization, talking past one another, and hostility. One of my personal interests is to open up communication between these groups to foster understanding and acceptance between them. I think we will all benefit from it.
