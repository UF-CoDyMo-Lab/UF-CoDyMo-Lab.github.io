## Research Interests

I am interested in developing numerical models to inform habitat management and conservation decision pathways, with a specific focus on endangered shorebirds.

## Research Visuals



## Personal Interests

I love learning about, understanding, and exploring the natural world. This includes hiking, camping, canoeing, kayaking, and wildlife photography. I train for Olympic-style weightlifting and love to workout and go to the gym. I also love to read books about philosophy and theology. Lastly, I have a Standard Schnauzer named Zeno (named after Zeno of Citium). He is always right alongside me to explore the world and one of my best friends!

## Favorite Quote

<blockquote>
"It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again; the never-satisfied man is so strange if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others."

  - Carl Friedrich Gauss
