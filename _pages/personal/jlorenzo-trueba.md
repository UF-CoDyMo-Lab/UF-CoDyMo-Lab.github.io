## Research interests

One of my research goals is to understand how physical, biological processes, and the coupling between them, influence coastal dynamics. Another research objective of mine is to understand how human activities affect coastal evolution, through both the accumulated effects of purposeful engineering activities and the unintentional consequences of land-use change.
Using novel conceptual and computer models, integrated with field and experimental efforts, I study a variety of environments, including river deltas, marshes, coastal barriers, and mangroves.
