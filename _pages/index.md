### We study <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> coastlines change.

Our lab is based out of University of Florida, [Geological Sciences](https://geology.ufl.edu/) in Gainesville Florida.

      <p>Our research aims to uncover the fundamental processes at coastal morphology and stratigraphic architecture such as fluvial deltas, barrier islands, marshes, mangroves, etc. These regions are our planet most dynamic regions, continously on small time-scale changes, and significantly populated with the majority of the world population. Integrating approaches that combine numerical modeling with field and laboratory data to decode the past and understanding the long-term evolutions. The coupled natural and human development systems are complex but essentially relevant to Florida and communities around the world.</p>
